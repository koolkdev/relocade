# Shared time and waits

`timer_service()` returns a `TimerHandle` and a `TimerDriver`. The driver starts
one dedicated timer worker. `run().await` keeps it alive until all timer handles
and waits are released. `spawn()` returns a `worker::CancellableWorker<()>` for
explicit lifetime control: `join().await` waits for normal completion, and `stop().await` cancels
remaining timers and waits for their worker to exit. Await either operation
before dropping the worker; terminating a browser worker early can skip Rust
destructors.

The shared `CancellableWorker<T>` owns cancellation and completion for both timer
and execution tasks. Each task handles its cancellation receiver: the timer loop
wakes, while the execution runner uses its existing checkpoint notifications.
Timer scheduling stays in `clock/driver.rs`.

`Clock::now()` reads elapsed time locally. `sleep(duration)` and
`wait_until(deadline)` send absolute deadlines to the driver and await Rust
channel notifications. Request delivery time therefore counts toward the wait.
Clones share their time origin across native threads and threaded browser workers.
Tests can implement `Clock` with manually controlled time.

The worker processes new requests and cancellations, completes expired timers,
then waits until the nearest absolute deadline. With no timers it waits until
another request or shutdown. Channel wakers notify the worker; a notification
before waiting is retained, so the request cannot be lost. Dropping a wait
wakes the worker to remove its timer. The timer list is small and local to the
worker; producers share only the request channel and response channels.

On native Windows, the worker waits on a high-resolution waitable timer and an
auto-reset event. The timer supplies the deadline; the event interrupts it for new requests,
cancellation and shutdown. Idle waits use only the event. This avoids the coarse
`WaitOnAddress` timeout used by Rust's timed parking without requesting a process
timer-resolution change. If these handles cannot be created, including on Windows
versions before 10 version 1803, the worker falls back to ordinary Rust parking.
Other native platforms also use Rust parking. The platform wait mechanism is private
to `clock/driver/wait`; timer handles and worker lifecycle APIs are unchanged.

By default, the threaded browser build's standard library implements `park` and
`park_timeout` with Wasm `memory.atomic.wait32`, and `unpark` with
`memory.atomic.notify`. This remains the path on macOS, Linux and unrecognized
browser environments. Browsers on Windows use a worker-local `MessageChannel`
task to arm each `setTimeout` instead: measured atomic waits there can round a
1–2 ms deadline up to about 15 ms. A fresh message task breaks the nested-timer
chain that otherwise clamps repeated timeouts to at least 4 ms. Platform selection
is isolated in `wait/browser/environment.rs` and requires no embedding options.

The browser backend yields to the timer worker's own event loop. Its message
handler recomputes remaining time from an absolute deadline; queueing the message
does not extend the wait. Requests, cancellation and shutdown use a retained Rust
notification and an `AtomicWaker`; they carry no JavaScript handles across threads.
Cancelling a deadline invalidates queued message work, clears any armed timeout
and settles its promise so Rust callbacks can be released. Worker shutdown closes
both message ports. The peer binding stays alive throughout the async driver.

`Clock::now()` reads the host's monotonic clock (`performance.now()` in the browser).
Every wake rechecks that clock; requested sleep duration is never treated as
elapsed time. All backends remain subject to host scheduling and browser throttling;
none guarantees millisecond deadlines or replays missed interrupts.

For a busy execution worker, bind its notification resource on the timer worker:

```rust,ignore
let (clock, driver) = relocade_machine::timer_service();
let execution = ExecutionWorker::spawn(clock, session);
let timers = driver.spawn_with_peer(execution.wake_peer());
let result = execution.join().await;
timers.stop().await?;
```

`spawn_with_peer` uses the existing worker resource transport to bind direct
notifications before processing timers. This avoids relaying browser timer wakes
through the spawning host's event loop. `ExecutionWorker::run_until` owns this
setup and stops execution before stopping its timer worker. Clocks used by other
independent sessions need their own service lifetime and notification bindings.

Timers are deadlines, not fixed-rate ticks. Host scheduling can still delay a
wake, and CPU checkpoints determine when an interrupt is serviced. Devices retain
their late-delivery policy: the PIT preserves its phase and coalesces missed edges
through the PIC. A 500 Hz mode-3 PIT has an output transition about every 1 ms.
The [PIT worker test](../../pit/tests/timer_worker.rs) exercises guest programming,
IRQ0 entry and EOI with the host event loop busy. Tight latency thresholds belong
in measurements, not correctness assertions dependent on the host scheduler.
